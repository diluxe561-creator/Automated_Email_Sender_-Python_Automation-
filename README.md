# Automated_Email_Sender_-Python_Automation-
This Python script securely sends automated emails via Gmail’s SMTP server. It uses `dotenv` to hide credentials in a `.env` file for safety and `SMTP_SSL` for encrypted communication. With built-in error handling and a modular design, it’s a reliable tool for sending notifications, reports, or project updates programmatically.
